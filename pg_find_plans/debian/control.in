Description: pg_find_plans is an experimental submodule of pg_stat_plans.
 pg_stat_plans is a framework for understanding plan execution costs, that by
 design exposes some relatively low-level, extensible functionality, to be
 used as clients see fit - plan costs are simply tracked in a view that the
 module makes available. Query texts stored by the module can be explained on
 an ad-hoc basis (the module manages some corner-cases with that), and
 machine-readable explain texts are made available via a simple function-call
 API.
