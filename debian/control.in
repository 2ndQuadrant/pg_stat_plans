Description: pg_stat_plans is a variant of the standard Postgres contrib module
 pg_stat_statements.  It differentiates between and assigns execution costs to
 plans, rather than queries.  This makes it particularly suitable for monitoring
 query planner regressions.  However, it is also suitable as a general-purpose 
 tool for understanding execution costs at both the plan and query granularity.
